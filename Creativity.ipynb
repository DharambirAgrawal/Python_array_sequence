    "To analyze the time complexity of a dynamic array that grows by \\( N + \\frac{N}{4} \\) instead of \\( 2N \\), let’s go over the amortized cost per append operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Analyzing the Growth Rate\n",
    "When the dynamic array reaches its capacity, we expand it to a new capacity of:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\text{new capacity} = N + \\frac{N}{4} = \\frac{5N}{4}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "So, each time we need to grow, we increase the capacity by \\( \\frac{N}{4} \\) additional cells (or 25% of the current size). We denote this operation as a *growth factor* of \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cost of Copying on Resizing\n",
    "When we resize the array, we need to copy all the existing elements to the new array. If we consider \\( k \\) resizing events over \\( n \\) total operations, the cost of each resizing event is proportional to the size of the array at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the total time spent on copying, let’s calculate the total amount of elements copied over all resizing events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Growth Pattern of the Dynamic Array\n",
    "Let’s track the capacity progression:\n",
    "- Initially, the capacity is \\( N \\).\n",
    "- After the first resizing, it becomes \\( \\frac{5N}{4} \\).\n",
    "- After the second resizing, it becomes \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\right)^2 N \\).\n",
    "- After \\( k \\) resizing events, the capacity will be \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\right)^k N \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "We stop resizing when this capacity reaches \\( n \\), so we need to find \\( k \\) such that:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\right)^k N \\geq n\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Taking the logarithm, we get:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "k \\approx \\log_{5/4} \\frac{n}{N} = \\frac{\\ln(n/N)}{\\ln(5/4)}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Thus, there are \\( O(\\log n) \\) resizing events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Total Copying Cost\n",
    "Now, let’s analyze the cost of copying over these \\( O(\\log n) \\) resizing events.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Size**: The first resizing costs \\( N \\) to copy.\n",
    "2. **Second Resizing**: The second resizing costs \\( \\frac{5N}{4} \\) to copy.\n",
    "3. **Third Resizing**: The third resizing costs \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\right)^2 N \\) to copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total cost \\( T(n) \\) for all resizing events (the sum of all copying costs) is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "T(n) = N + \\frac{5N}{4} + \\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\right)^2 N + \\cdots\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "This is a geometric series with ratio \\( \\frac{5}{4} \\), so we can sum it as follows:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "T(n) = N \\sum_{i=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\right)^i\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, \\( S = \\frac{a(1 - r^{m+1})}{1 - r} \\), we get:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "T(n) = N \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\left( \\frac{5}{4} \\right)^{k+1}}{1 - \\frac{5}{4}}\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "Since \\( k = O(\\log n) \\), this sum converges to \\( O(n) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Amortized Cost per Operation\n",
    "The total cost for \\( n \\) append operations is \\( O(n) \\). Therefore, the amortized cost per append operation is:\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "\\frac{O(n)}{n} = O(1)\n",
    "\\]\n",
